# Binary-Linear-Search
This was a class assignment that looked at the average number of steps that it took for binary and linear search to complete in. 

It looked at using keyLinear, keyBinary, sortedLinearInput, and sortedBinaryInput when opening files and reading through them.
It will take the average of the linear and bianry and then divide it by it's key_lin or key_bin in order to know the average steps taken to complete.
